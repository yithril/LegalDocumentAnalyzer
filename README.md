# ðŸ§¾ Legal Document Intelligence Platform

A scalable, multi-tenant system for analyzing, classifying, and summarizing legal documents through agentic AI workflows. Designed to enable law firms to extract structure, timelines, actors, relationships, and summaries from unstructured legal documents while respecting role-based access control (RBAC) and tenant isolation.

---

## Project Goals

This platform is designed to:

- Automatically classify and chunk legal documents
- Extract timelines, actors, summaries, and relationships
- Build vector-based semantic search on document chunks
- Create an updatable knowledge graph of legal events and actors
- Enforce strong role-based access within tenants (law firms)
- Support multi-tenancy with one database per tenant
- Leverage local LLMs like **SaulLM** instead of expensive APIs
- Orchestrate services with **Temporal** for robust fault-tolerant pipelines
